# Having the following application created with `create-react-app` complete the following tasks:
- The application renders without crashing
- A CatForm component is rendered
- The CatForm has inputs for `name`, `type` È™i `mass`
- Given that the inputs for the cat properties have the ids `name`, `type` and `mass` and that the add button has the value `add` a cat can be successfully added
- After adding a cat, the fields are reset to their initial value (0.5 pts)
- Create a delete button on each cat, the application rerenders on each delete call
