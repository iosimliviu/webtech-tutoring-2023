# TOPIC: Javascript

# Given that there is an object type called Vehicle complete the following tasks:
 
 - define the `Car` type which is a child type and it inherits `Vehicle` 
 - a `Car` instance cannot be created without a `name` of type `string`. If `name` has a different type a `CreationError` will be correctly thrown
 - a `Car` instance can make a stop via a parent's `makeStop()` method which returns `${name} makes a stop`
 - a `Car` cannot drive and will return `${name} is a Car and cannot drive` if asked
 - a `Car` has an additional method `fuels(liters)` which returns `${name} fuels ${liters}`
